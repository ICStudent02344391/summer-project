By observing Figures \ref{fig:regret_bern} and \ref{fig:regret_hoeff}, it is clear that the $\epsilon$-Greedy algorithm underperforms regardless of the configurations. For Bernstein's bound, the Sequential Halving algorithm appears to perform better than UCB, particularly for partitions with a large number of arms (J in 50, 100). Conversely, the UCB algorithm seems to perform better with Hoeffding's bound, especially for partitions with 10 and 50 arms, but not for the partition with 100 arms.
